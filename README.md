README Template: AI Agent Design and Evaluation

This template is designed to guide you through the Programming Exercise 2-1: Design and Evaluate an AI Agent assignment. You will use this to complete the no-code programming tasks below.
This document serves as a README file that introduces a project by explaining its purpose, setup instructions, and usage details, helping users and collaborators quickly understand what 
the project does and how to work with it. It also serves as a reference point for future development, troubleshooting, and onboarding new contributors.


TASK 1: Complete this section My Chosen AI Agent: [Insert your chosen AI agent here]
1. Study Buddy AI
2. Community Helper AI
3. Creative Assistant AI
4. Personal Wellness AI
5. Smart Retail AI

Task 2: Add your responses here for Agent Overview:

1. What data does this AI need to collect? [Your response here]

2. How does it interact with users? [Your response here]

3. What decisions does it make? [Your response here]

4. What is its main goal? [Your response here]

5. How could it be misused, even if unintentionally? [Your response here]

Task 3: Add your flowchart image here from draw.io "No-Code Programming" 

AI Agent Flowchart: Use markdown and diagrams within [draw.io](https://draw.io/) to create a visual flowchart of your AI agent's core decision-making process. 
example replace with your image. Just remove this link then copy and paste your image here.
